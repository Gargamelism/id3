# id3

A simple ID3v2 parser. Supports most common features of [ID3v2.3](http://id3.org/id3v2.3.0) and [ID3v2.4](http://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure).

## Artifact

## Usage

To parse the ID3 tag of an MP3:
```clojure
(with-mp3 [mp3 "foo.mp3"] (:tag mp3))
; {:artist "Michael Jackson" :title "Smooth Criminal"}
```

To write a new MP3 file with modified tags:
```clojure
(with-mp3 [mp3 "foo.mp3"]
  (write-mp3 "bar.mp3"
    (assoc-in mp3 [:tag :title] "Thriller")))
```

Or to overwrite an existing file's tags:
```clojure
(overwrite-tag "foo.mp3"
  (with-mp3 [mp3 "foo.mp3"]
    (assoc (:tag mp3) :title "Thriller")))
```

## API

When using this API, keep in mind the distinction between a "tag" (just the ID3 metadata; see `read-tag`) and an "mp3" (both the metadata and the audio data; see `read-mp3`).

### read-tag
```clojure
(read-tag istream & opts)
```
Reads an ID3v2 tag from `istream`. The only option is `:format`, which determines the format into which the tag will be parsed. Values:
- `:simple` _(default)_ A basic format that supports only common ID3 frames, and only one value per text frame. For a list of supported frames and their keys, see the output of `(frame-keywords N)`, where `N` is 3 (for ID3v2.3) or 4 (for ID3v2.4).
```clojure
{:artist "Billy Joel", :title "Piano Man"}
```
- `:normal` A more comprehensive format that should support all common cases. Note that values for text frames are always vectors, because ID3v2.4 supports multiple values for all text frames.
```clojure
{"TPE1" ["Billy Joel"], "TIT2" ["Piano Man"]}
```
- `:full` Everything but the kitchen sink. This is way more info than you probably want or need, but it tells you nearly everything about the ID3 tag in gory detail.
```clojure
{:frames (
  {:encoding "UTF-8", :content ["Billy Joel"], :size 11, :id "TPE1", :flags #{}}
  {:encoding "UTF-8", :content ["Piano Man"], :size 10, :id "TIT2", :flags #{}}),
 :size 1059, :flags #{}, :version {:minor 0, :major 4}, :magic-number "ID3"}
```

### read-mp3
```clojure
(read-mp3 src & opts)
```
Parses the MP3 file at `src` (anything accepted by `clojure.java.io/input-stream`). Returns a map with these keys:
- `:tag` the parsed ID3 tag
- `:data` an *open input stream* positioned after the ID3 tag (i.e. at the start of the MPEG frames). You need to close this stream when you're done with it, but see `with-mp3`.

Options as in `read-tag`.

### with-mp3
```clojure
(with-mp3 [sym src & opts] & body)
```
Convenience macro that evaluates `body` with `sym` bound to the mp3 at `src`, then closes the mp3's input stream. Options as in `read-mp3`.

### write-tag
```clojure
(write-tag ostream tag & opts)
```
Writes an ID3v2 tag to `ostream`. Writes only the tag, not any audio data. Options:
- `:version` ID3v2.x tag version to write (3 or 4, default 4)
- `:encoding` character encoding to use for text frames, etc. ID3v2.3 supports ISO-8859-1 and UTF-16; ID3v2.4 also supports UTF-16BE and UTF-8.
- `:padding` bytes of padding to write (default 1024)

### write-mp3
```clojure
(write-mp3 dest tag & opts)
```
Writes an mp3 (tag and audio data) to `dest` (anything accepted by `clojure.java.io/output-stream`). Options as in `write-tag`.

### overwrite-tag
```clojure
(overwrite-tag path tag & opts)
```
Overwrites the ID3 tag of the existing MP3 file at `path`. Will avoid rewriting the file's audio data if possible. Options as in `write-tag`, but `:padding` may be ignored.

## Caveats

- ID3v2.2 is unsupported.

- Some uncommon features are unsupported, such as encryption, compression, and unsynchronisation. Notably, appended tags are unsupported because this is a stream-oriented library, and appended tags are impossible to parse from a stream without discarding or storing in memory the file's entire audio data.

- Any frames that are not text, picture, or URL frames are currently just parsed as binary blobs. Let me know if there's another frame type you'd like to see supported.

- Even though ID3v2.3 technically supports multiple values for certain text frames, this library always treats ID3v2.3 text frames as having a single value. This is because the spec uses `/` as a delimiter and makes no provision for escaping literal slashes, which makes it impossible to represent artists like `AC/DC` correctly (and in general makes round-tripping impossible). In addition, support for multiple values among other tag parsers is inconsistent. It's just too error-prone to handle at the parser level; if you want multiple values in ID3v2.3, you'll have to deal with them yourself.
